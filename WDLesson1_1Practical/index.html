    <!-- Challenge 1: Change the title of the page to Web Technologies -->
    <title>Web Technologies</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Challenge 2: Create a heading, h1 for Web Technologies -->
    <h1>Web Technologies</h1>
    
    <!-- Challenge 3: Create a heading, h3 for HTML -->
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <!-- Challenge 4: Create a paragraph explaining what is HTML. At least 3 sentences. -->
    <ol>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it's the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML consists of a series of elements that tell web browsers how to display content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, tables, and more. By wrapping content in specific HTML tags, developers can define the structure and meaning of web page elements, allowing browsers to interpret and render the content correctly.</ol>

    <h3>CSS: Creating the Web</h3>
    <!-- Challenge 6: Create a paragraph explaining what is CSS.  At least 3 sentences. -->
    <ol>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it's a styling language used to control the layout and appearance of web pages written in HTML or XML. CSS is used to add visual styles, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and more, to web pages, making them more visually appealing and user-friendly. By separating presentation logic from structure, CSS enables developers to create consistent and maintainable styles across entire websites, allowing for efficient updates and a cohesive design.</ol>

    <h3>JavaScript: Bringing Interactivity to Life</h3>
    <!-- Challenge 8: Create a paragraph explaining what is JavaScript.  At least 3 sentences. -->
    <ol>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language that adds interactivity to web pages, enabling developers to create dynamic effects, animate elements, respond to user interactions, and update content on the fly. With JavaScript, developers can build complex web applications, create responsive user interfaces, and enhance the overall user experience. It's used for client-side scripting, allowing developers to create interactive web pages that can respond to user input, animate graphics, and update dynamically without requiring full page reloads.</ol>
