        <p>
          Once upon a time there was a little boy named <span id="boyspan1">Billy</span>. 
          He was not like all the other children, because he had a very big secret. 
          Everyday he went to school hoping no one had discovered the truth. 
          You see <span id="boyspan2">Billy</span>'s parents were really <span id="veg1">Pickle</span>. 
          How he turned out to be a normal boy, he didn't know.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was time for parent teacher conferences and <span id="boyspan3">Billy</span> was afraid of everyone finding out his secret. 
          How, oh how, would he explain!? 
          Hey, wait a minute! When he looked around he saw <span id="girlspan">Michelle</span>, the most popular girl in class and her parents were <span id="veg2">Garlic</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wow, what a relief, <span id="boyspan4">Billy</span> wasn't so different after all!
